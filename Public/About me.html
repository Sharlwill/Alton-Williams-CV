<h2>About Myself</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<h>
    <p>There was never anything else I wanted to do but become a chef. It is evident in what I watch and do in my spare time.
        Th road to becoming a qualified chef was not an easy one. I only got my qualification 8 years after starting in the industry. I could have been happy woring at that level but I wanted more.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>In 2010 I got the opportunity to travel to England. It was here where I did a short "internship" at a pub in Mickleton, Gloustershire. My life was forever changed. Up to that point I have never eperienced cooking that is wrapped in so much care and dedication cooking with the produce available in the area. It's something that I have aspired to go back to ever since.</p>
    </p>

    However something inside of me knew it was time to aspire to better. This is why, from 2010, you see me moving jobs so often. I wanted more and needed to get it no matter what.
    
    <p>Over the years I have built up experience working with all types of people - of all ages and genders. I have been working in the hospitality industry for more than fifteen years encountering people from all walks of life.</p>

    <p>I am vibrant and energetic with a good work ethic. No request is ever too big for me. I am well-spoken, confident and am a good team-player. I always give my best in all I do and I consider myself reliable and hardworking.</p>
    <p>  I am constantly pushing myself, setting new goals and reaching them and am up for any challenge that I might be presented with.
    <p>My professionalism, punctuality, and strong work ethic makes me a reliable and trustworthy member of any kitchen team. My ability to handle pressure and meet deadlines without compromising quality further underscores my dedication to my craft.</p>

<h3>Cooking Styles</h3>

    <p>I am not one of those chefs who has one specific cooking style. It really depends on where I find myself or the day, the time, even the season.</p>
    <p> I do believe that people who know me may feel diffrently</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My colleagues may say I have a mix between english and mediterranean cooking styles and I do love to venture into new vegan and special dietary cuisine</li>
        <li>My friends will, without a doubt, say I love cooking with fire. That is because in South Africa, when we get together it's always over some "braaied" or grilled meat. And since I have started smoking meat I am often reminded that we are overdue for a get together because no one "smokes" like I do. </li>
        <li>My family has the best of both worlds and although I live with two cooks who can hold their own in any kitchen, Everyone always raves when I put my hand to a good old fashioned stew or soup. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I do believe any cooking style can be mastered as long as it is done with heart.</p>
